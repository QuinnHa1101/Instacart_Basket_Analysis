# Instacart_Basket_Analysis
Data-driven analysis to identify hidden patterns in sales data. I aim to refine their market segmentation strategies by conducting a thorough exploratory analysis with Python.
# Objective
Instacart, an online grocery store, already has outstanding sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. As an analyst, I performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
# Key questions
* The sales team needs to know the busiest days of the week and hours of the day (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) to schedule ads when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether people spend the most money at particular times of the day, as this might inform the type of products they advertise.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want more straightforward price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in their system's different types of customers and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
* What's the distribution among users regarding their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
* Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
* Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
* Is there a connection between age and family status regarding ordering habits?
* What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
* What differences can you find in the ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency, the products customers order, and anything else you can think of.
# Data source
The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially fabricated customer datasets. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.

# Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following supporting libraries:
* Pandas: for data analysis
* Numpy: for mathematical equations
* Seaborn: for data visualizations
* Matplotlib: for data visualizations
* SciPy: for mathematical equations
# Folders
The project files are stored in the following folder structure:
* 01 Project Management: Project brief
* 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders: Original Data, which contains the original data frames, and Prepared Data contains the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.)
* 03 Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing coding for the analysis.
* 04 Analysis: The Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations for developing and explaining insights.
* 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel
